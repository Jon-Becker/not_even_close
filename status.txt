TODO:
- Prismatic barrier 15% dr on group + Improved Prismatic Barrier
- Change some talents to be passive modifiers for other talents, like Ursine Vigor

Not planning on doing for now
- All tank spells
- Physical damage. It's a lot of work
- Aug mastery: hard to calculate, and nobody plays around it (it's used on cd for dps). Quite powerful tho
- Chrono ward: same as above
- Matted fur: hard to calculate and is very small absorb
- Light's Protection: hard to play around and not really worth it for 2% DR
- Echoing Blessings on Sac: not worth it for 2% DR (32% instead of 30%)
